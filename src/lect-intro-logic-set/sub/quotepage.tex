    Let's start at the very beginning \\
    A very good place to start. \\
    When you read you begin with A-B-C. \\
    When you sing you begin with do-re-mi. \\
    (\dots) \\
    Now children, do-re-mi-fa-so and so on \\
    are only the tools we use to build a song. \\
    Once you have these notes in your heads, \\
    you can sing a million different tunes by mixing them up. \\
    Like this. \\
    So Do La Fa Mi Do Re \\
    (\dots) \\
    But it doesn't mean anything. \\
    So we put in words. One word for every note. Like this. \\
    When you know the notes to sing \\
    You can sing most anything
